# FDR - Programming with RDF

FDR is a TypeScript library for building applications backed by an [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) model and the Semantic Web Technology Stack in general (SPARQL, triplestores, OWL ontologies, inferencing etc.).

FDR makes use of the [RDFJS APIs](https://rdf.js.org/), but considers them as a low level foundational layer. 

The goals of FDR as a framework and a toolkit are:

- Provide a set of abstractions that makes programming with models and data represented in RDF easy and fun.
- Provide facilities for state management that include UI state, caching and synchronization with backend (typically SPARQL endpoints).
- Make it possible to extend with one's one abstractions for front-end or backend integration with non-standard APIs (i.e. APIs that don't follow the [SPARQL HTTP protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/))
